# scNODE: Generative Model for Temporal Single Cell Transcriptomic Data Prediction

scNODE is a generative model that simulates and predicts realistic *in silico* single-cell gene expressions at any timepoint. scNODE integrates the idea of variational autoencoder (VAE) and neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to model cell developmental landscapes on the non-linear manifold. scNODE is scalable to large-scale datasets.
