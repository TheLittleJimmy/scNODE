# baseline

Codes for all baseline models: PRESCIENT and MIOFlow.
We use source codes available on GitHub to run baseline models.

## PRESCIENT

We constructed a wrapper ([./prescient_model/running.py](./prescient_model/running.py)) to use PRESCIENT in our benchmark.
PRESCIENT codes are available at [here](https://github.com/gifford-lab/prescient).


## MIOFlow

We constructed a wrapper ([./MIOFlow_model_revised/running.py](./MIOFlow_model_revised/running.py)) to use MIOFlow in our benchmark.
MIOFlow original codes are available at [here](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/MIOFlow/tree/main).
